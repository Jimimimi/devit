## A few words about the DEVit conference

>DEVit is a 360Â° Web Development Conference (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Mobile). The idea is that we want to get our attendees out of their comfort zone and cross pollinate all arts and crafts that make today's World Wide Web possible.

This is the second time that we are organizing DEVit and we aim to make it an **unforgettable experience**! Last year's DEVit took place next to the sea at the awesome venue of [Makedonia Palace Hotel](http://www.makedoniapalace.com/) and attracted over **350** people. It was a blast for every speaker, attendee and DEVit volunteer. We had such a great time and great knowledge was disseminated towards all directions. You can have a look at last year's [site](http://devitconf.org/2015/) and awesome [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131931106@N08/sets/72157653228840910/)!

This year's DEVit is happening on **Friday the 20th of May, 2016**, in an even bigger venue, [Vellidio Conference Hall](http://profile.helexpo.gr/profile/en/thessaloniki%20vellidis). Thessaloniki is at its best during May and speakers can enjoy Greece's sunshine and warm beaches during the weekend following the event, they are just an hour away!

## Absence of women speakers on 2015 lineup

Last year lineup was one of our weak points and it has been discussed thoroughly on our retrospectives. We have already turned the page and we are aiming to **achieve a 50/50** split on our **lineup**.

## Regarding expenses

We offer to pay all the **traveling and accommodation** costs of the speakers except if their company wishes to sponsor any or all of their expenses and in that case we'd gladly add them as **sponsors of the DEVit conference**.

## Hononarium

Since we are a **community backed conference** a honorarium is something we can not currently afford. We hope from next year to be able to do that. What we do cover apart from the accommodation and travel expenses, are the **dinner on Thursday night** (May 19th), the **transportation** from/to the airport and a **mini city tour** with a guide (speakers and DEVit staff) that will take place prior to the speakers dinner.

Be a part of DEVit by applying to our [CFP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WOPx_vhoXwR4HBYp3HVAkr5OkV-ysiYbWz4WINsCR_Q/viewform?c=0&w=1):
