In this post we will go through the economics of organizing a world class conference, we will see how DEVit fared in 2015 and 2016 compare the two and plan for 2017.

## DEVit in numbers

Let's dive straight into the numbers, you will need coffee! In 2016 DEVit sold a total of 349 tickets, that was 13.5% higher than 2015 when we sold 302. In 2016 there were an additional 70 people in the conference comprising of sponsor and DEVit staff and VIPs.

The gross income for DEVit 2016 was €23,715.44 up 46.23% from 2015 at €16,217.54. Some healthy growth there in gross income, however not the same picture in profits. In 2016 our profit after taxes was €1,527.10, which represents 6.88% of the gross income. The same profit index for 2015 was at 5.22% for €845.75.

### Diving into expense and income sources

In 2016 55% of total revenue came from ticket sales, the remaining 45% came from sponsorships. In 2015 ticket sales represented 66.5% of total revenue and sponsors 33.5%.

In very gross terms, in 2016 Catering and Venue represented 30.6% of the expenses while in 2015 the same number was at 52% dwarfing all other expenses, so take note on this and be extra careful with the venue deals you make.

## Analyzing the outcome

All numbers look good, they are on the plus side of growth, however you need to understand that it was only in 2016 that we were able to pay some of the people that worked professionally, you can see that as an 11.5% of the total expenses. These contractors where people that provided their work pro bono on DEVit 2015 so that it would become a reality. And we are still far from being able to pay everyone involved for their professional services.

Like we've said before, DEVit is organized in our free time and while one of our goals is to make this a self sustainable organization that will create one or two full time positions, we are still far from getting there. The economics don't yet add up.

Another crucial factor to take under consideration here is that DEVit's legal entity is a Non Profit Organization (NPO), so on whatever profit you see mentioned here there is no additional state tax nor there is any Value Added Tax (VAT) on the selling of the tickets or the sponsor packages. Should this be a for-profit venture the profits would definitely be diminished by tax and required legal and accounting upkeep.

## Looking ahead, planning for 2017

Having established the DEVit experience and having a good understanding of the economics of organizing large scale conferences with international speakers we took a bold decision to move forward and grow the conference bigger. Two times bigger to be exact at an estimated budget of €50,000 for expenses of the conference. Our decision was based on upgrading workshops to a first class citizen and expanding DEVit to a second day dedicated to workshops.

The bigger budget allows us for the first time ever to afford speakers from across the Atlantic and be able to host more speakers from many days before the event to participate in the "DEVit Week" and mingle with the locals.
