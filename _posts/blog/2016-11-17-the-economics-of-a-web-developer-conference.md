DEVit, as everyone knows, is a non-profit conference organized by members of the tech community using their free time. However, DEVit as an organization, is far from just a hobby... It is how, each and every one of us, makes an effort to move the tech industry in Greece one step further. Developers get educated and niche down to their field of expertise, founders make new deals, find new talent and get to appreciate the geek culture. The whole ecosystem benefits from such a major organization like DEVit and in this post we will see how each and everyone of you are a part of this.

## The DEVit Economics

Having a few MBAs amongst our midst we were able to employ some pretty expert budgeting and cash flow techniques to stay on course and manage to operate DEVit with a profit, even a small one. Financial responsibility in a non-profit organization is of utmost importance so as to not oblige any of the organizing members to put down money from their pockets. So we strongly encourage conference organizers to have at least one person keeping tabs on cash flow and budgeting in a weekly basis as the event comes close to execution.

So let's see how DEVit 2015 and 2016 faired from an economic standpoint. In 2016 DEVit sold a total of 349 tickets, that was 13.5% higher than 2015 when we sold 302. In 2016 there were an additional 70 people in the conference comprising of sponsor and DEVit staff and VIPs.

> The gross income for DEVit 2016 was €23,715.44 up 46.23% from 2015 at €16,217.54. 

Some healthy growth there in gross income, however not the same picture in profits. In 2016 our profit after taxes was €1,527.10, which represents 6.88% of the gross income. The same profit index for 2015 was at 5.22% for €845.75.

So what we learn from these numbers are basically two things. First one, is that conferences, especially in small markets like Greece is, are not that much profitable. Considering that we are a non-profit organization these nearly 2k of profit over two years would get diminished should we be a for-profit corporation, after taxes and insurance payments. 

The second thing that we learn is that meaningful profit can only come from scale. At scale, you get economies of scale, which allow you to handle funds differently and in a more optimized way. By scale we basically mean attendees. Another way to be profitable with current attendee numbers is to raise the ticket 10x from what it is today. So on DEVit 2016, the "normal ticket", the most expensive ticket you could buy, sold at just €60. I've been to conferences that I paid for the ticket nearly €600, with this kind of ticket and 300 attendees you are sure to make a profit, however these kind of scenarios are not feasible for our market (Greece).

### Diving into expense and income sources

In 2016 55% of total revenue came from ticket sales, the remaining 45% came from sponsorships. In 2015 ticket sales represented 66.5% of total revenue and sponsors 33.5%. So what you can easily observe here is that we rely more and more on our sponsors to cover the costs of the conference so we can keep the attendee ticket as low as possible. We hope we can retain that trend in the years to come.

In very gross terms, in 2016 Catering and Venue represented 30.6% of the expenses while in 2015 the same number was at 52% dwarfing all other expenses, so take note on this and be extra careful with the venue deals you make.

## Analyzing the outcome

All numbers look good, they are on the plus side of growth, however you need to understand that it was only in 2016 that we were able to pay some of the people that worked professionally, you can see that as an 11.5% of the total expenses. These contractors where people that provided their work pro bono on DEVit 2015 so that it would become a reality. And we are still far from being able to pay everyone involved for their professional services.

Like we've said before, DEVit is organized in our free time and while one of our goals is to make this a self sustainable organization that will create one or two full time positions, we are still far from getting there. The economics don't yet add up.

Another crucial factor to take under consideration here is that DEVit's legal entity is a Non Profit Organization (NPO), so on whatever profit you see mentioned here there is no additional state tax nor there is any Value Added Tax (VAT) on the selling of the tickets or the sponsor packages. Should this be a for-profit venture the profits would definitely be diminished by tax and required legal and accounting upkeep.

## Looking ahead, planning for 2017

Having established the DEVit experience and having a good understanding of the economics of organizing large scale conferences with international speakers we took a bold decision to move forward and grow the conference bigger. Two times bigger to be exact at an estimated budget of €50,000 for expenses of the conference. Our decision was based on upgrading workshops to a first class citizen and expanding DEVit to a second day dedicated to workshops.

The bigger budget allows us for the first time ever to afford speakers from across the Atlantic and be able to host more speakers from many days before the event to participate in the "DEVit Week" and mingle with the locals.
